== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why doesn't the feature XX work ? =

If you have found a bug, or the plugin doesn't work correctly, please feel free to contact me.
I will do my best to fix an issue.

= How to use category icons ? =

If you need to have an icon associated with a category I'd suggest you to add a custom category field.
I have provided an example of adding a custom category field. You can find it in the `example/category-icon` folder.
Or you can use your own implementation. The plugin provides a specific filter for that purpose.
The name of the filter to hook - `accordion_category_icon`.
